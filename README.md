# Open Meta Agents
Open Meta Agents is an open experimental project dedicated to creating a toolbox for building a dynamic virtual world with interactive and generative agents, mainly driven by large language models (like ChatGPT). It would be incredibly useful for designing virtual NPCs that interact seamlessly in sandbox games, generating scripts for novels, theater, movies, or other simulation cases for the open agents interationâ€”limited only by your imagination.

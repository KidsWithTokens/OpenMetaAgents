# Open Meta Agents
Meta Agents is an open experimental project dedicated to creating a toolbox for building a dynamic virtual world with interactive and generative agents, mainly driven by large language models (like ChatGPT). It would be incredibly useful for designing virtual NPCs that interact seamlessly in sandbox games, generating scripts for novels, theater, movies, or other simulator needed casesâ€”limited only by your imagination.

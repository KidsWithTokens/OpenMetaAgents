- Terrill Bloodscar is a level 1 human ruffian who is a member of the Redbrand ruffians and wants to rob and kill adventurers.

Based on the provided information, it seems that Daran Edermath has just arrived in Phandalin and is interacting with various NPCs in the town square. Toblen Stonehill is a wealthy wizard who owns a trading post, while Linene Graywind is a competent bard who runs a trading post. Harbin Wester is the pompous townmaster of Phandalin, and Terrill Bloodscar is a ignorant human ruffian who wants to rob and kill adventurers.

As a level 1 half-elf rogue, Daran Edermath may have some opportunities to interact with these NPCs and potentially gain their trust or form alliances with them. However, it's also possible that Daran may be seen as a threat or an outsider by some of these NPCs, particularly Toblen Stonehill and Terrill Bloodscar, who may be wary of adventurers in general.

It's worth noting that the relationships between these NPCs are complex and may be influenced by a variety of factors, including their innate traits, their past experiences, and their current goals and motivations. As Daran Edermath explores Phandalin and interacts with these NPCs, he may uncover more information about their personalities and motivations, which could potentially impact his own actions and decisions in the game.

ToweMaster Harbin is described as "pompous" and "old food," which suggests that he is dismissive or disdainful of Robber Terrill and the Redbrand ruffians. Additionally, ToweMaster Harbin is shown to be busy calculating the tax of the town at the time when Robber Terrill is planning the robbery, which implies that he is more concerned with his own duties than with the criminal activities of the Redbrand.

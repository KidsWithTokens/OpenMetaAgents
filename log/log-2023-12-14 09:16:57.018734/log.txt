- [December 14, 2023, 09:25 AM] I, Retireadven Daran, walked into the bustling town of Red Rock, my eyes scanning the crowd for any sign of trouble. I had heard rumors of a group of Redbrand ruffians causing chaos in the area, and I was determined to put a stop to it. As I made my way through the streets, I noticed a group of rough-looking men eyeing me up and down, their eyes filled with hostility. I knew I had to be careful, but I also knew that I couldn't let them intimidate me. I took a deep breath and approached them, my hand on the hilt of my sword. "Excuse me," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "But could you tell me where I might find the leader of this town? I have some business to discuss with him." The men snickered among themselves, and one of them stepped forward, a cruel grin spreading across his face. "You're looking for the Postowner, eh? Well, you've come to the right place. He's just over there, behind that building." He nodded towards a large, imposing structure at the end of the street. I thanked him and made my way towards the building, my senses on high alert. As I approached, I could hear raised voices coming from inside, and I knew that I was in for a confrontation.

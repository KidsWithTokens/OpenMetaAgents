Mind Tree of people:  Daran Edermath

relevant_mem is: Daran Edermath is a 30-year-old half-elf rogue who has been in Phandalin for a few days, looking for work. They have heard rumors of a trading post for sale in the town, and are considering purchasing it. They are currently in the town square, looking for information about the post and trying to gather resources to make the purchase.
What is the relationship between Daran Edermath and Toblen Stonehill? Are they friends, enemies, or something else entirely? How does Toblen view Daran, and how does Daran view Toblen?

Toblen Stonehill is a grumpy, arrogant old man who owns a trading post in Phandalin. He is mean and gossipy, and has a reputation for being selfish. Daran Edermath has just arrived in Phandalin and is looking to purchase the trading post.

When Daran approaches Toblen in the town square, Toblen looks up from his gossip with a scowl on his face. "What do you want, kid?" he growls.

Daran introduces themselves and explains their interest in purchasing the trading post. Toblen snorts in disgust. "A half-elf? Running a trading post? You'll never make it in this town."

Toblen proceeds to tell Daran all the reasons why they are unsuitable for the job, from their age and race to their lack of experience and connections in the town. Daran listens patiently, trying to gather information and resources to help them make their purchase.

As they speak, it becomes clear that Toblen has a strong dislike for Daran. He views them as an outsider and a threat to his own business, and is unwilling to help them in any way. Daran, on the other hand, is polite and respectful, but also determined to succeed in their goal. They are not necessarily enemies, but they are certainly not friends.

In summary, the relationship between Daran Edermath and Toblen Stonehill is one of mutual dislike and distrust. Toblen views Daran as an outsider and a threat, while Daran is determined to succeed in their goal of purchasing the trading post despite Toblen's opposition.
